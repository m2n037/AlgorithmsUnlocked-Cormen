# Implementation of Algorithms Unlocked

This repository contains implementations of algorithms from the Cormen's [Algorithms Unlocked](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/algorithms-unlocked) book in Python and C++. This is an effort to learn programming and algorithms. 

## Why Python and C++
These two languages are used for programming robots, in which I am interested in. In fact, [Robotics Operating System (ROS)](www.ros.org) is used through Python and C++ the most.
